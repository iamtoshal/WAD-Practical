    <h2>Static NodeJS Application</h2>
    <p>
        Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript
        engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side scripting and
        the development of scalable and high-performance network applications.

        Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and well-suited for handling
        concurrent requests and real-time applications. It provides a rich set of built-in modules and libraries,
        allowing developers to easily build various types of applications, including web servers, command-line tools,
        desktop applications, and more.

        One of the key features of Node.js is its package manager called npm (Node Package Manager), which provides
        access to a vast ecosystem of open-source libraries and frameworks. This makes it easy for developers to
        leverage existing solutions and rapidly build applications using reusable code.

        Node.js has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its performance, scalability, and the ability
        to write server-side applications in JavaScript, which is a language widely used for client-side scripting in
        web development. It has become a popular choice for building web servers, microservices, APIs, and real-time
        applications, and it is widely supported by various hosting platforms and cloud services.
